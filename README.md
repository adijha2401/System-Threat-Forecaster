# System-Threat-Forecaster
The goal of this project is to predict a systemâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that system. The telemetry data containing these properties and the system infections was generated by threat reports collected by system's antivirus software.

# Dataset Description
- **Dataset**: _train.csv_, _test.csv_
- **Submission Format**: id, target
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy Score between predicted and actual values.

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **MachineID**: Unique identifier for each machine.
- **ProductName**: Name of the installed antivirus product.
- **EngineVersion**: Version of the antivirus engine.
- **AppVersion**: Version of the antivirus application.
- **SignatureVersion**: Version of the antivirus signatures.
- **IsBetaUser**: Whether the user is on a beta version of the antivirus.
- **RealTimeProtectionState**: Status of real-time protection.
- **IsPassiveModeEnabled**: Whether passive mode is enabled.
- **Other features**: Several system properties such as OS version, number of antivirus products installed, physical RAM, and more.
- **Target**: A binary indicator (0 or 1) indicating if the machine is infected by malware.

# Models Implemented
The following Machine Learning Models were used to predict the target variable:

- **Decision Tree**: The baseline model used to compare performance.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model that improves upon decision trees, later used as a feature selector.
- **Logistic Regression**: A simple linear model used for binary classification.
- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier**: via LightGBM, a gradient boosting model that performs well on large datasets.

## Best Performing Model: HistGradientBoostingClassifier
After evaluating the listed models, HGBC provided the best Accuracy Score of 0.6280.

# Future Work
I've identified several promising directions for future research:

- Incorporation of temporal features to capture infection patterns over time
- Ensemble approach combining multiple model strengths
- Deep learning approaches for feature extraction from raw telemetry data
- Explainability enhancements for security operations teams
